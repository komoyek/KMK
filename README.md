## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem

Traditional educational models often struggle with student motivation and engagement. Current reward systems are disconnected from real-world value, resulting in short-term memorization rather than authentic skill development.

Quizify-io, powered by the KOMOYEK token, addresses these challenges by:

- Creating a blockchain-verified record of skill achievement
- Providing immediate, tangible rewards for learning milestones
- Establishing a token economy that connects educational achievement with real-world value
- Enabling a decentralized skills verification system
- Incentivizing continuous learning and skill improvement

  - Dedicated to ongoing platform development
  - Subject to 2-year vesting period with quarterly releases
  
- **Institutional Partnerships (15%)**: 1,500,000 KMK
  - Reserved for educational institution adoption
  - Locked with 1-year cliff and 3-year vesting
  
- **Founding Team (10%)**: 1,000,000 KMK
  - 3-year vesting period with 6-month cliff
  
- **Initial Liquidity (5%)**: 500,000 KMK
